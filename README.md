BLOOD CELL COUNTER APP

Using the images below, a tester app was created to be able to show, detect and count the amount of blood cells that appear in an image.

The app counts the connected pixels above and below a certain hue, saturation and brightness values. 
In this case the hsb value was in around red, for red blood cells and purple for purple blood cells.

A button is available to premtively set the colour to red, purple or white using hsb values for the best visibility of the image and its blood cells.
